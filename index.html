        <div class="w-50 d-block mx-auto">
            <h3 class="text-center mt-4">Why has this happened why?</h3>
            <p class="mt-4">It is clear that, based on United States President's statements in regard to his decision on
                pulling American forces from Syria their fight against ISIS alongside the Kurds, that President Trump does not care about
                the Kurdish people or their welfare. Not only did he pull out United States forces, leaving the Kurds to
                be ethnically cleansed by Turkish forces, he then had the audacity to blame the Kurds, calling them "no
                angels" and claiming that the Kurds do not deserve support from the United States because the Kurds
                didn't help them in the fight at Normandy in World War II.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center mt-2">What will happen to the Kurds?</h3>
            <p class="mt-4">Since President Trump has once again proven to the world that he is unfit for his office by
            making a catastrophic decision, despite all of the experts advising him urging him not to, the Kurds have
            fallen victim to the latest example of the United States of America being unreliable as an ally. Due to this
            revelation by the Kurds, they have wisely decided to seek other allies to help protect them against an all
                but certain genocide by Turkish forces. </p>

            <p>The Kurds found that Syria is a reliable ally that can be counted on
            in a time of need such as now. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has been very generous to take the Kurds
            in with open arms, letting them know that they will have a haven to go to when they need it. And the Kurds
            <i>desperately</i> need haven, now more than ever.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center mt-2">What can I do to help?</h3>
            <p class="mt-4">If you are not one of the Kurdish people, the best thing you can do is to speak out against
            this disgraceful betrayal of an ally by United States President Donald Trump. We must spread the word that
            the United States cannot be allowed to abandon these people to their deaths and be able to simply shrug
            their shoulders and say "whatever".</p>
            <p>If you are one of the Kurdish people, the world requires nothing more from you than what you have given.
                You are standing strong in a time of great crisis. Even before this astonishing betrayal of your people,
            more than 10,000 of your soldiers laid down their lives to help the United States fight their enemy, only to
            have a dagger stuck in your back later by those that you sacrificed for. If you truly want to help, find a
            local government official and ask them what the best way to help in the fight is. They will be happy to help
            you.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h4 class="text-center mb-5">We must all thank the Kurds for their sacrifice in fighting evil in this world and
                for them being able to stand strong in the face of terror.</h4>
